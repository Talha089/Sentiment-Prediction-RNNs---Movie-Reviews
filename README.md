# Sentiment-Prediction-RNNs---Movie-Reviews

## Instructions
* Load in text data
* Pre-process that data, encoding characters as integers
* Pad the data such that each review is a standard sequence length
* Define an RNN with embedding and hidden LSTM layers that predicts the sentiment of a given review
* Train the RNN
* See how it performs on test data



- Note about GPUs
In this notebook, you'll find that training the network is much faster if you use a GPU. However, you can still complete the exercises without a GPU. If you can't use a local GPU, we suggest you use cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, and FloydHub to train your networks on a GPU.
